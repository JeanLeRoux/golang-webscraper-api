  "Body": "Apple's fall iPhone event is next week - and we'll find out if the company is superstitious.Apple is expected to unveil the iPhone 13 next Tuesday. But Jon Prosser, who is occasionally correct about these sorts of leaks, reported rumoured notch-less iPhone 14 plans on Wednesday, sending #iPhone14 trending on Twitter.Some users speculated if, given the rumoured leak, that Apple would bypass the iPhone 13 label altogether and go straight to iPhone 14.Iphone 14 is trending? Did we just skip 13 altogether? pic.twitter.com/I2LVg2v1AfThe number 13 is considered unlucky in many Western countries, a superstition that might date back thousands of years, according to History.com. For example, the Stress Management Center and Phobia Institute estimated between $700 (around R9.9 billion) to $800 (around R11 billion) million dollars are lost every Friday the 13th each year because people are skittish about travelling or operating businesses, as CNBC reported in 2010.Some hotels skip over the number 13 when numbering their floors, some airlines will omit labelling the 13th row on their aircraft, and airports usually skip from gate 12 to gate 14.However, that doesn't mean Apple will do the same to avoid scaring off superstitious would-be iPhone customers - just look at its iPhone 4 release in 2010. The company rolled it out despite the number 4 being considered unlucky in parts of Asia, especially China - the Chinese words for \"four\" and \"death\" sound similar.The iPhone 4 still sold well in the market - with its online retail store selling out of the units within 10 hours - even as other electronics makers like Canon and Nokia skipped from 3 to 5 when labeling models, according to the LA Times.Besides, Apple doesn't seem to have a history of shying away from the number 13 if its product names to date are any indication.MacBooks are typically identified only by the year in which they are released and their length, such as the MacBook Pro 13-inch. But the technical identifier for the MacBook generation rolled out in 2016 was the MacBookPro13, according to the Apple website. And Apple also rolled out its iOS 13 software update in late 2019. Some Apple products simply haven't been updated more than 12 times yet, like the iPad, which is currently on its eighth generation."

  "Body": "Apple has fired a prominent female employee who spoke out publicly about allegations of harassment and discrimination at the company, for leaking confidential information, multiple outlets reported.For the past few months, senior engineering programme manager Ashley Gjøvik has been openly tweeting allegations of bullying and mismanagement at the tech giant, claiming senior employees kept a whiteboard tally of votes on how they could make her \"life a living hell\", that she was regularly excluded from important emails, and that some were known to peer-pressure other employees into drinking alcohol during working hours. On Thursday night, Gjøvik tweeted that she had received an email from Apple's employee relations team, regarding a \"sensitive intellectual property matter.\" Hours later, The Verge reported Gjøvik's contract had been terminated via email. Bloomberg and Gizmodo also reporting on the firing.\"When I began raising workplace safety concerns in March, and nearly immediately faced retaliation and intimidation, I started preparing myself for something exactly like this to happen,\" Gjøvik told The Verge. \"I'm disappointed that a company I have loved since I was a little girl would treat their employees this way.\"Asked about Gjøvik's termination, an Apple spokesperson told The Verge: \"We are and have always been deeply committed to creating and maintaining a positive and inclusive workplace.\"The spokesperson added: \"We take all concerns seriously and we thoroughly investigate whenever a concern is raised and, out of respect for the privacy of any individuals involved, we do not discuss specific employee matters.\"Gjøvik's complaints came weeks before the launch of \"#AppleToo\", a website built for employees at the company to share stories of mistreatment and misconduct. Gjøvik had also filed a complaint with the National Labor Relations Board in August.Among the hundreds of current and former employees to submit complaints was Barbara Underwood, who told Insider she was in the process of suing the firm for $1.7 million (around R24 million), claiming management failed to deal with her repeat allegations of sexual harassment, assault, and \"verbal, emotional, and physical abuse\" against a male coworker.Insider approached Gjøvik and Apple for further comment."

  "Body": "Linkedin co-founder Reid Hoffman said young Mark Zuckerberg had a quiet demeanor that led to \"minutes-long pauses in conversation\" on Bloomberg's The David Rubenstein Show this Wednesday. He added that the young Facebook CEO was \"very quiet\" but he \"could see that he was very smart.\" Hoffman said he ultimately became an early investor in Facebook due to the social network's usage curve after it first launched on Harvard's campus. \"In six weeks, 80% of the campus was using it six times or more per day,\" he told Bloomberg. Zuckerberg started Facebook as a 19-year-old computer science and psychology student at Harvard. According to Hoffman, he displayed the characteristics of \"highly successful software entrepreneurs,\" even at such a young age. \"Mark obviously had a bunch of interesting... knowledge and attributes,\" Hoffman said on the show. Now 37 years old, Mark Zuckerberg is one of the last remaining Big Tech founder still running his company. The founding entrepreneurs of Google, Amazon, Apple, and Microsoft have all passed along the reins to new management, though Jack Dorsey returned in recent years to run Twitter's day to day operations.From virtual reality meetings to building the metaverse, Zuckerberg is trying hard to keep his company's entrepreneurial spirit alive in the face of antitrust and misinformation backlash. \"The trajectory that Facebook was on was really interesting,\" Hoffman concluded at the end of the show."

  "Body": "Google is reportedly facing another EU competition investigation, this time over the dominance of its voice assistant on Android.On Thursday, Sam Wilkin, managing editor of regulatory news service MLex, tweeted that the tech giant faced another investigation from European authorities \"over possibly forcing device manufacturers to use Google Assistant as the default voice assistant on Android devices.\"Insider approached Google for comment. The EU Commission declined to comment. Google Assistant, equivalent to Siri on the iPhone, has been a default feature on most new Android devices since 2017. The AI-powered assistant was first launched in 2016, and can schedule meetings, answer basic queries, or initiate phone calls, among other features.Earlier in 2021, EU competition chief Margrethe Vestegar signaled she was unnerved by the dominance of a few voice assistants on the continent, and suggested pre-installation was anti-competitive. She also expressed concerns about the way voice assistants collect people's data.\"In the EU, Google Assistant, Amazon's Alexa and Apple's Siri are the leading voice assistants,\" she said at the time, adding that \"there are concerns about default settings and pre-installation on voice assistants.\"The EU has already fined Google for anticompetitive behaviour - involving search, shopping, and Android - three times in three years: first for $2.7 billion (around R38 billion) in 2017, again for $5 billion (around R71 billion) in 2018, and once more for $1.7 billion (around R24 billon) in 2019."

  "Body": "The 1,020-horsepower Tesla Model S Plaid can smoke any production car you pit it against. But is there a stock motorcycle that can beat the super sedan in a straight line?That's what Edmunds aimed to find out when it brought a Plaid and two of the quickest superbikes on the planet to the track for a recent video. (Watch the clip below.)Both the Suzuki Hayabusa and the Kawasaki Ninja ZX-14R are tremendously quick, packing larger engines and more horsepower than many cars. They both claim a limited top speed of 299 k/ph and promise to demolish a quarter mile in under 10 seconds.If any two-wheelers could stand a chance against Tesla's most off-the-wall vehicle yet, it would be these. Edmunds gave the Hayabusa and Ninja ZX-14R a fair shot by enlisting motorcycle drag racer Chris Moore for the tests. Although the motorcycles could keep up with the Plaid at their best, neither could deliver a decisive win over the Tesla. The Hayabusa won one roll-on race starting at 64 k/ph, but it may have jumped the start. From a standing start, the Tesla was clearly quicker. There is one edge that the bikes may have over the Plaid: longevity. Edmunds' Carlos Lago, the Plaid's driver, noted that the car's performance had degraded slightly after a handful of speed runs. Another pro is price. If you want to go outrageously fast and not drop six figures, both the Hayabusa and Ninja ZX-14R can be had for under 20 grand. The main lesson to draw from Edmunds' tests: the Model S Plaid beats not only every four-wheeled vehicle, but any stock road-going vehicle you can buy, period. And that's not all that surprising, given that this is a four-door sedan that puts any Lamborghini, Ferrari, or McLaren to shame. Another takeaway? Please don't try this at home."

  "Body": "Twitter is now testing a feature that lets users remove followers discreetly without having to block them, the company's support branch announced on Tuesday evening. The announcement is the first in a slate of changes planned by the social media platform to promote what it calls \"social privacy,\" Bloomberg reported. The aim is to give users more control over their reputations and identities.To remove a follower, go to your profile and click â€œFollowersâ€, then click the three dot icon and select â€œRemove this followerâ€. pic.twitter.com/2Ig7Mp8Tnx — Twitter Support (@TwitterSupport) September 7, 2021Before this change, Twitter users could only remove followers by blocking them, preventing the other user from sending them a direct message or viewing their tweets. In order to make it less obvious that a person has been blocked, some users do what's called a \"soft block.\" As Insider's Dave Johnson explained, soft blocking is when you block and then quickly unblock a follower. \"Blocking forces the other person to unfollow you and erases your direct message history, but because you then unblock the person, they can still see your tweets, so they don't appear to be blocked. It gives the impression that they unfollowed you by accident, or perhaps due to a glitch on Twitter,\" he wrote. Twitter did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment.."

  "Body": "Parts of South Africa will have a great opportunity to see the International Space Station (ISS) streaking overhead on Wednesday night, 8 September.The ISS will pass over Gauteng at the right time, in the right spot, and with the right weather forecast, for those in Johannesburg and Pretoria to get a particularly good view.Bloemfontein is also in luck – but Cape Town and Durban not so much.The ISS has been passing over South Africa low on the horizon for good viewing. At anything under 40 degrees, Nasa says, your odds aren't great, because the landscape and buildings tend to get in the way. Light pollution is also a bigger problem lower in the sky.But on Wednesday, the ISS will max out at 71 degrees above the horizon in Johannesburg, and at 60 degrees in Bloemfontein, as opposed to 30 degrees in Durban.For the far more westerly Cape Town, the sun will get in the way.The sunset will be at 6:33 pm (in Cape Town) and you still have too much light to be able to observe the reflected light??of the Space StationThe viewing window will be 7 minutes long, starting at 18:48.In both Johannesburg and Bloemfontein, the glint of the space station will come from low in the southwest. In Johannesburg it will disappear again low on the northeast horizon; in Bloemfontein it will travel to north-northeast. As of late on Wednesday morning, weather forecasts were for clear skies above Gauteng and the Free State.(Compiled by Phillip de Wet)"
